# HOW TO BUILD CUSTOM CKEDITOR
In order to use the plugin, we need to build a custom ckeditor.
There are 2 ways:
1. Add ckeditor dependency to your project and pack it with other javascripts
2. Build ckeditor separately 

The 2nd method is a preferred way because we only have to built it once, which speed up the 
building process.

The process of 2nd method is described in ckeditor5-samples/ckeditor5/README.md
