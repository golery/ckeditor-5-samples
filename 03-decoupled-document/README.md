While ckeditor 5 classic attaches the toolbar to the top of editing area, the decoupled-document build allows to deployed the toolbar in a separate location.


This sample illustrates:
- Load ckeditor 5 decoupled-document build from CDN
- Instantiate the editor, which the toolbar is loaded into a dedicated "div".
