This folder contains clones of build repository from ckeditor.

#WHY DO WE NEED THIS?
You don't need these build to run sample. The sample loads the ckeditor from CDN directly.

However, if you need to dig into source code of ckeditor, it's much more convenient to rebuild the source code without uglificiation.
